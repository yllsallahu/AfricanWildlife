        <p class="p-maintext">It is the second-largest living big cat 
             after the tiger. Males are unique among the cat<br>
              species for their thick mane of brown or black hair encircling their head and neck.<br> 
              The mane darkens with age, and the thicker and darker a mane is the healthier the<br> 
              cat. Both males and females roar — a sound heard as far as 8 kilometers away.<br></p>

                    <p class="p-main3">This cat’s population is steadily decreasing in the wild. In just two decades, populations decreased by 43 percent, and it’s estimated that as few as 23,000 remain today. One of the main causes is the alarming rate at which they are losing their habitats due to expanding human populations and the resulting growth of agriculture, settlements, and roads.</p>
            
                    <p class="p-main2">Human-wildlife conflict is also a major threat.</p>
            
                    <p class="p-main3">As lion habitats shrink, the big cats are being forced into closer quarters with humans. This, coupled with a decrease in their natural prey, causes them to attack livestock. In turn, farmers oftentimes retaliate and kill these big majestic cats.</p>
            
                    <p class="p-main2">They are hunted by humans.</p>
                    <p class="p-main3">These big cats are being killed in rituals of bravery, prized as hunting trophies, and, increasingly, for their body parts' perceived medicinal and magical powers.</p>

        <p class="p-main2">Mitigate human-wildlife conflict.</p>
        <p class="p-main3">Retaliation is the primary reason people kill this big cat. We work with communities to help them realize the big cat’s value and to help them protect their families and livestock from carnivore predation. In Ruaha National Park, where 10 percent of the world’s remaining lion population can be found, AWF’s Ruaha Carnivore Project is fostering a much-needed shift in the local opinion of carnivores.

            Since 2012, AWF has been working with Ruaha’s communities to build livestock enclosures to protect livestock from predation, and, in turn, protect big cats and other carnivores from conflict with humans. In addition, Ruaha Carnivore Project provides community benefits to villages that demonstrate success in living peacefully with carnivores.

        <p class="p-main3">African Wildlife Foundation’s researchers are working to gain an understanding of carnivores’ populations, behaviors, movements, and interactions with people in order to develop appropriate conservation actions. Since 2002, our Large Carnivore Research Project has undertaken research aimed at ensuring the continued survival of large predators living around Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. There are few regions as important to the viability of lion populations as the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem. Halting the decline of lion populations in this region is imperative to the long-term success of the species. The African Wildlife Foundation partners with the Tarangire Lion Research Initiative to compile data from the local lion population. This data helps us better understand the demographic composition of lions in the landscape and pinpoint areas of potential threat to the species. To mitigate human-lion conflict, AWF has designed and constructed predator-proof enclosures for herdsmen to protect their cattle from lion attacks and hosts ongoing education and awareness programs to inform the community about safeguarding their livestock. As a result of AWF and community efforts, there has not been a single retaliatory killing in the landscape since March 2018.</p>
