		<h2>About Lion- Our Strategy to Save Lions</h2>	
		<p>Lions probably speak more directly to people than any other wild species. Through art, through literature, through symbolism and heraldry, through representations on flags and national emblems, lions have a universality that appeals regardless of culture, race, and national origin. Lions represent such a strong image to the world that words cannot but fail to express the true level of their iconic impact.</p>
